PRAVAKTA ðŸŒŸ
Your Careerâ€™s GPS: Mentorship, Community & Clarity, Powered by Open-Source AI

1:1 Mentorship: Connect with vetted experts whoâ€™ve walked your path.

Domain-Specific Communities: Collaborate, learn, and grow in niche tribes (e.g., Non-Tech to Tech).

AI-Powered Tools: Smart matching, spam-free communities, and accessible resources.

Tech Stack

Frontend: React.js + LOVABLE.AI (UI/UX)

Backend: javascript

AI: Llama 2 (matching), Hugging Face (moderation), Whisper (transcriptions)
